# 🔒 Message Encryption/Decryption Tool 
 
A lightweight Python utility for securely encoding and decoding messages using a simple XOR encryption mechanism, combined with Base64 encoding for safe transmission.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Encode Messages:** Transform plaintext into a secure encoded format.
- **Decode Messages:** Retrieve the original message using the correct 6-digit key.
- **Easy to Use:** Simple CLI interface for encoding and decoding.
- **Secure:** Uses a 6-digit key for XOR encryption, ensuring message confidentiality.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Encoding
1. XOR operation is performed between the message and the key.
2. The result is encoded using Base64 for safe transmission.

### Decoding
1. Base64 encoded input is decoded.
2. XOR operation is used to retrieve the original message.

## 📦 Installation

 • Copy and paste the code in main.py program then run it in terminal using python. Or you may do it the boring way.

---

⚙️ Usage

Run the script in your terminal:

python3 main.py

Follow the prompts to encode or decode a message.

📋 Example

Encoding

Message: HelloWorld

Key: 123456

Encoded Message: QFZVF1YPFhg=


Decoding

Encoded Message: QFZVF1YPFhg=

Key: 123456

Decoded Message: HelloWorld

🚨 Important Notes

The key must be a number.

Base64 ensures the encoded message is safe for transmission, but decoding requires the correct key.

Handle your keys responsibly!
