# 🔒 Message Encryption/Decryption Tool

Read this yap by chatgpt.

A lightweight Python utility for securely encoding and decoding messages using a simple XOR encryption mechanism, combined with Base64 encoding for safe transmission.

## 🚀 Features
- **Encode Messages:** Transform plaintext into a secure encoded format.
- **Decode Messages:** Retrieve the original message using the correct 6-digit key.
- **Easy to Use:** Simple CLI interface for encoding and decoding.
- **Secure:** Uses a 6-digit key for XOR encryption, ensuring message confidentiality.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Encoding
1. XOR operation is performed between the message and the key.
2. The result is encoded using Base64 for safe transmission.

### Decoding
1. Base64 encoded input is decoded.
2. XOR operation is used to retrieve the original message.

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/message-encryption-tool.git
cd message-encryption-tool

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.


---

⚙️ Usage

Run the script in your terminal:

python3 encryption_tool.py

Follow the prompts to encode or decode a message:

Encoding: Input the message and a 6-digit key to receive an encoded output.

Decoding: Input the encoded message and the same 6-digit key to retrieve the original message.

📋 Example

Encoding

Message: HelloWorld
Key: 123456
Encoded Message: QFZVF1YPFhg=

Decoding

Encoded Message: QFZVF1YPFhg=
Key: 123456
Decoded Message: HelloWorld

🚨 Important Notes

The key must be a 6-digit number.

Base64 ensures the encoded message is safe for transmission, but decoding requires the correct key.

Handle your keys responsibly!
